DOMINO1 is located in the nucleus.  Arabidopsis embryos carrying the domino1 mutation grow slowly in comparison with wild type embryos and reach only the globular stage at desiccation. The primary defect of the mutation at the cellular level is the large size of the nucleolus that can be observed soon after fertilization in the nuclei of both the embryo and the endosperm.  DOMINO1 might have a role in ribosome biogenesis and in determining the rate of cell division.	protein_coding

AT3G24650	AT3G24650.1	Homologous to the maize transcription factor Viviparous-1. Full length ABI3 protein binds to the highly conserved RY motif [DNA motif CATGCA(TG)], present in many seed-specific promoters, and the B3 domains of this transcription factor is necessary for the specific interaction with the RY element. Transcriptional activity of ABI3 requires the B3 DNA-binding domain and an activation domain. In addition to the known N-terminal-located activation domain, a second transcription activation domain was found in the B1 region of ABI3. ABI3 is essential for seed maturation. Regulator of the transition between embryo maturation and early seedling development. Putative seed-specific transcriptional activator. ABI3 is a central regulator in ABA signaling and is unstable in vivo.  It interacts with and can by polyubiquitinated by AIP2 in vivo. Based on double mutant analyses, ABI3 interacts genetically with both FUS3 and LEC1 and is involved in controlling accumulation of chlorophyll and anthocyanins, sensitivity to abscisic acid, and expression of the members of the 12S storage protein gene family. In addition, both FUS3 and LEC1 regulate positively the abundance of the ABI3 protein in the seed.  Alternative splicing of ABI3 is developmentally regulated by SUA (AT3G54230).	protein_coding	ABA INSENSITIVE 3 (ABI3)	SUGAR INSENSITIVE 10 (SIS10);ABSCISIC ACID INSENSITIVE 3 (ABI3); (ATABI3);ABA INSENSITIVE 3 (ABI3)

AT5G65700	AT5G65700.1	Encodes a CLAVATA1-related receptor kinase-like protein required for both shoot and flower meristem function. Very similar to BAM2,with more than 85% a.a. identity. It has a broad expression pattern and is involved in vascular strand development in the leaf, control of leaf shape, size and symmetry, male gametophyte development and ovule specification and function. Anthers of double mutants (bam1bam2) appeared abnormal at a very early stage and lack the endothecium, middle, and tapetum layers. Further analyses revealed that cells interior to the epidermis (in anther tissue) acquire some characteristics of pollen mother cells (PMCs), suggesting defects in cell fate specification. The pollen mother-like cells degenerate before the completion of meiosis, suggesting that these cells are defective. In addition, the BAM1 expression pattern supports both an early role in promoting somatic cell fates and a subsequent function in the PMCs.

The photoreceptor may be involved in electron transport. Mutant phenotype displays a blue light-dependent inhibition of hypocotyl elongation. Photoreceptor activity requires light-induced homodimerisation of the N-terminal CNT1 domains of CRY1. Involved in blue-light induced stomatal opening. The C-terminal domain of the protein undergoes a light dependent conformational change.  Also involved in response to circadian rhythm. Mutants exhibit long hypocotyl under blue light and are out of phase in their response to circadian rhythm.  CRY1 is present in the nucleus and cytoplasm.

AT1G04400	AT1G04400.2	Blue light receptor mediating blue-light regulated cotyledon expansion and flowering time. Positive regulator of the flowering-time gene CONSTANS. This gene possesses a light-induced CNT2 N-terminal homodimerisation domain.Involved in blue-light induced stomatal opening. Involved in triggering chromatin decondensation. An 80-residue motif (NC80) is sufficient to confer CRY2's physiological function.  It is proposed that the PHR domain and the C-terminal tail of the unphosphorylated CRY2 form a "closed" conformation to suppress the NC80 motif in the absence of light. In response to blue light, the C-terminal tail of CRY2 is phosphorylated and electrostatically repelled from the surface of the PHR domain to form an "open" conformation, resulting in derepression of the NC80 motif and signal transduction to trigger photomorphogenic responses. Cry2 phosphorylation and degradation both occur in the nucleus.The life-time of cry2 signaling state in situ (in planta) is about 16 min.	protein_coding	CRYPTOCHROME 2 (CRY2)	 (AT-PHH1); (PHH1);CRYPTOCHROME 2 (CRY2); (FHA); (ATCRY2)

AT3G60190	AT3G60190.1	At3g60190 encodes Arabidopsis dynamin-related protein 1E, DRP1E, also known as EDR3, ADL4 and ADL1E, which is 624 amino acid residues long, has a predicted mass of 69.8 kDa and a pI of 7.5.  Dynamin-related protein 1E belongs to a plant-specific subclass of dynamin-related proteins (DRP1), consisting of five members in Arabidopsis (A, B, C, D, E). This class is characterized by having an N-terminal GTPase domain, a central `dynamin 2` domain and a C-terminal GTPase effector domain (GED), a typical structure for plant dynamin-related proteins. However, this class lacks a PH domain and a proline-rich domain, which are found in classical animal dynamin-like proteins. Based on work on animal dynamins, the plant DRP1 proteins should be able to form polymeric structures that wrap around membranes to facilitate membrane tubulation and pinching off of vesicles, processes that are essential to vesicle trafficking and membrane compartmentalization.  The edr3 mutation causes a P77L substitution in the G2 motif of the GTPase domain of DRP1E.  edr3 mutant Arabidopsis plants display enhanced cell death in response to powdery mildew infection.	protein_coding	DYNAMIN-LIKE 1E (DL1E)	ARABIDOPSIS DYNAMIN-LIKE 4 (ADL4);DYNAMIN-LIKE PROTEIN 2 (ADLP2);DYNAMIN-LIKE 1E (DL1E);DYNAMIN-RELATED PROTEIN 1E (DRP1E);DYNAMIN-LIKE 1E (ADL1E);ENHANCED DISEASE RESISTANCE 3 (EDR3)

AT3G55360	AT3G55360.1	Enoyl-CoA reductase is involved in all very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA) elongation reactions that are required for cuticular wax, storage lipid and sphingolipid metabolism. The protein is located in the ER, but in contrast to its yeast homolog TSC13 is not particularly enriched in the nuclear envelope-vacuole junction. Mutants in this gene show abnormal organ morphology and stem glossiness. Cells in all tissues are only about 1/3 of the size of wild type cells. The morphological changes are most likely to result from the reduction in the VLCFA content of sphingolipids. Mutants also show abnormalities in the endocytic membrane organization and transport as well as reduced trichome papillae.	protein_coding	ECERIFERUM 10 (CER10)	ECERIFERUM 10 (CER10);ENOYL-COA REDUCTASE (ECR);GLASSY HAIR 6 (GLH6); (ATTSC13); (TSC13); (CER10)

AT2G26330	AT2G26330.1	Homologous to receptor protein kinases. Involved in specification of organs originating from the shoot apical meristem. Contains a cytoplasmic protein kinase catalytic domain, a transmembrane region, and an extracellular leucine-rich repeat.  ER has been identified as a quantitative trait locus for transpiration efficiency by influencing epidermal and mesophyll development, stomatal density and porosity of leaves. It has been implicated in resistance to the bacterium Ralstonia solanacearum and to the necrotrophic fungus Plectosphaerella cucumerina.  Together with ERL1 and ERL2, ER governs the initial decision of protodermal cells to either divide proliferatively to produce pavement cells or divide asymmetrically to generate stomatal complexes. ER binds to the peptides STOMAGEN and EPF2 which compete for the same binding site. The ER-EFP2 complex activates MAPK signaling that inhibits stomatal development. ER-STOMAGEN does not activate MAPK signaling. Plants harboring loss of function alleles of er are more susceptible to heat stress than wild type.

AT3G16770	AT3G16770.1	Encodes a member of the ERF (ethylene response factor) subfamily B-2 of the plant specific ERF/AP2 transcription factor family (RAP2.3).  The protein contains one AP2 domain. There are 5 members in this subfamily including RAP2.2 AND RAP2.12.It is localized to the nucleus and acts as a transcriptional activator through the GCC-box. It has been identified as a suppressor of Bax-induced cell death by functional screening in yeast and can also suppress Bax-induced cell death in tobacco plants. Overexpression of this gene in tobacco BY-2 cells confers resistance to H2O2 and heat stresses. Overexpression in Arabidopsis causes upregulation of PDF1.2 and GST6.   It is part of the ethylene signaling pathway and is predicted to act downstream of EIN2 and CTR1, but not under EIN3. The mRNA is cell-to-cell mobile.	protein_coding	ETHYLENE-RESPONSIVE ELEMENT BINDING PROTEIN (EBP)	RELATED TO AP2 3 (RAP2.3);ETHYLENE-RESPONSIVE ELEMENT BINDING PROTEIN (ATEBP);ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR 72 (ERF72);ETHYLENE-RESPONSIVE ELEMENT BINDING PROTEIN (EBP)

AT2G33860	AT2G33860.1	ettin (ett) mutations have pleiotropic effects on Arabidopsis flower development, causing increases in perianth organ number, decreases in stamen number and anther formation, and apical-basal patterning defects in the gynoecium. The ETTIN gene encodes a protein with homology to DNA binding proteins which bind to auxin response elements. ETT transcript is expressed throughout stage 1 floral meristems and subsequently resolves to a complex pattern within petal, stamen and carpel primordia.  ETT probably functions to impart regional identity in floral meristems that affects perianth organ number spacing, stamen formation, and regional differentiation in stamens and the gynoecium. During stage 5, ETT expression appears in a ring at the top  of the floral meristem before morphological appearance of the gynoecium, consistent with the proposal that ETT is involved in prepatterning apical and basal boundaries in the gynoecium primordium.  It is a target of the ta-siRNA tasiR-ARF. ETT is also a target of AP2; integrateing the functions of AGAMOUS and APETALA2 in floral meristem determinacy.	protein_coding	ETTIN (ETT)	ETTIN (ETT);AUXIN RESPONSE TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR 3 (ARF3)

AT1G50240	AT1G50240.2	The FUSED (FU) gene belongs to Ser/Thr protein kinase family and has a key role in the hedgehog signaling pathway known to control cell proliferation and patterning in fruit flies and humans . Arabidopsis thaliana genome has a single Fu gene that is involved in male meiosis cytokinesis. Cytokinesis-defective mutants, named two-in-one (tio), result from mutations in Arabidopsis Fu. Phenotypic analysis of tio mutants reveals an essential role for TIO in conventional modes of cytokinesis in plant meristems and during male gametogenesis. TIO is tightly localized to the midline of the nascent phragmoplast and remains associated with the expanding phragmoplast ring. This gene was previously annotated as two gene models, AT1G50230.1 and AT1G50240.1, however the experimental evidence exists (Oh et al, Current Biology, 2005) showing that these two models are in fact single gene, named FUSED.	protein_coding	FUSED (FU)	FUSED (FU);TWO IN ONE (TIO)

GPA1 is a positive regulator in ABA-mediated inhibition of stomatal opening. Plants with recessive mutant alleles have complex phenotypes including: reduced brassinolide response, reduced cell divisions, round leaves, short hypocotyls.  It is likely to be involved in the signaling events that trigger unfolded protein response-associated cell death. GPA1 is also involved in sugar signaling.

AT2G30470	AT2G30470.1	HSI2 is a member of the ABI3 family of B3 domain proteins and functions as an active repressor of the Spo minimal promoter through the EAR motif. It contains a plant-specific B3 DNA-binding domain. It is expressed at similar levels in all organs. Treatment with 6% sucrose showed a slight increase in transcript levels after 24 h. No changes were observed after treatment with 50?M ABA. It is localized in the nucleus via a nuclear localization sequence located in the fourth conserved region of the C-terminal B3 domain. HSI2 is also an epigenetic repressor as it also contains functional plant homeodomain-like (PHD-L) and zinc-finger Cys- and Trp-containing (CW) domains associated with epigenetic regulation. The PHD-L domain of HSI2 is connected to promoting trimethylation of Lys-27 on histone 3 (H3K27me3), while the CW domain can bind directly to H3K4me3. Through these domains, HSI2 represses the seed maturation program during seed germination by repressing transcription of the core LAFL (LEC1, ABI3, FUS3, and LEC2) seed developmental transcriptional regulators. In developing A. thaliana embryos, HSI2 suppresses expression of a large number of genes, many identified as targets of FUS3. However, the absence of HSI2 had no effect on transcript levels of the LAFL regulators and the levels of measured metabolites and phytohormones (ABA, auxin, and JA derivatives) in developing Arabidopsis embryos. HSI2 likely fine-tunes seed maturation by repressing genes involved in early embryogenesis that are not required later for seed maturation and desiccation.	protein_coding	HIGH-LEVEL EXPRESSION OF SUGAR-INDUCIBLE GENE 2 (HSI2)	VP1/ABI3-LIKE 1 (VAL1);HIGH-LEVEL EXPRESSION OF SUGAR-INDUCIBLE GENE 2 (HSI2)

AT3G54610	AT3G54610.1	Encodes a histone acetyltransferase that is plays a role in the determination of the embryonic root-shoot axis.  It is also required to regulate the floral meristem activity by modulating the extent of expression of WUS and AG.  In other eukaryotes, this protein is recruited to specific promoters by DNA binding transcription factors and is thought to promote transcription by acetylating the N-terminal tail of histone H3. The enzyme has indeed been shown to catalyse primarily the acetylation of H3 histone with only traces of H4 and H2A/B being acetylated. Non-acetylated H3 peptide or an H3 peptide that had been  previously acetylated on K9 both serve as excellent substrates  for HAG1-catalyzed acetylation. However, prior acetylation  of H3 lysine 14 blocks radioactive acetylation of the  peptide by HAG1.  HAG1 is specific for  histone H3 lysine 14.	protein_coding	HISTONE ACETYLTRANSFERASE OF THE GNAT FAMILY 1 (HAG1)	HISTONE ACETYLTRANSFERASE 1 (HAT1);GENERAL CONTROL NONDEREPRESSIBLE 5 (GCN5);BIG TOP (BGT);HISTONE ACETYLTRANSFERASE OF THE GNAT FAMILY 1 (HAG1); (HAC3); (HAG01)

The sequence in GenBank has 17 AG dinucleotide repeats missing, which is also missing in Ler shotgun sequence from Cereon. Although it is annotated to be in Columbia, the GB sequence is probably not of Columbia origin. Plays a role in embryogenesis as mutants grown at higher temperatures display abnormalities in the organization of the root and shoot. Plant lines expressing an RNAi construct targeted against HDA19 shows some resistance to agrobacterium-mediated root transformation.

AT5G03150	AT5G03150.1	JKD is a nuclear-localized putative transcription factor with three zinc finger domains. jkd mutants show a number of root patterning defects including ectopic periclinal divisions in the cortex, increased cell numbers in the cortical and epidermal layers, a disrupted QC marker expression pattern, and disorganized QC and columella cells. jkd mutants also have a reduced number of meristematic cells in their roots. JKD can interact with the SCR and SHR proteins implicated in root patterning, as well as another zinc finger transcription factor, MAGPIE. All of these interactions require the first zinc finger in JKD according to a Y2H assay. There are also transcriptional interactions among these proteins. The initiation of JKD transcription does not appear to depend on SCR and SHR, but later expression in the post-embryonic QC cells and ground tissue initials is reduced in scr and shr mutants. JKD also appears to be required for SCR transcription beginning in the embryo. There is also some evidence that JKD plays a role in promoting the movement of SHR into the nucleus, particularly in QC cells, but this may be indirect.

AT5G64813	AT5G64813.1	The LIP1 gene encodes a small GTPase that influences the light input pathway of the plant circadian network. An MBP:LIP1 fusion protein has GTP hydrolyzing abilities in vitro. In plants, LIP1 seems to play a negative role in regulating circadian period that can be suppressed by light. LIP1 also seems to negatively affect light-pulse-dependent resetting of the clock, especially during the first portion of the subjective evening. LIP1 expression levels are not significantly affected by the circadian clock in seedlings grown under LL conditions. The levels of the YFP:LIP1 protein expressed under the control of the 35S promoter, shows a low amplitude variation, with protein levels peaking near the beginning of subjective night under LL conditions. In hypocotyl epidermal cells of dark and light-grown seedlings, a YFP:LIP1 fusion protein can be seen in the cytoplasm and the nucleus, and does not cluster in nuclear speckles.

AT5G58230	AT5G58230.1	Encodes a WD-40 repeat containing protein that functions in chromatin assembly as part of the CAF1 and FIE complex. Mutants exhibit parthenogenetic development that includes proliferation of unfertilized endosperm and embryos. In heterozygous plants 50% of embryos abort. Of the aborted embryos the early aborted class are homozygous and the later aborting lass are heterozygotes in which the defective allele is maternally transmitted. Other phenotypes include defects in ovule morphogenesis and organ initiation,as well as increased levels of heterochromatic DNA. MSI1 is needed for the transition to flowering. In Arabidopsis, the three CAF-1 subunits are encoded by FAS1, FAS2 and, most likely, MSI1, respectively. Mutations in FAS1 or FAS2 lead to increased frequency of homologous recombination and T-DNA integration in Arabidopsis. In the ovule, the MSI1 transcripts are accumulated at their highest level before fertilization and gradually decrease after fertilization. MSI is biallelically expressed, the paternall allele is expressed in the endosperm and embryo and is not imprinted. MSI1 forms a complex with RBR1 that is required for activation of the imprinted genes FIS2 and FWA. This activation is mediated by MSI1/RBR1 mediated repression of MET1.	protein_coding	MULTICOPY SUPRESSOR OF IRA1 (MSI1)	MULTICOPY SUPRESSOR OF IRA1 (MSI1);ARABIDOPSIS MULTICOPY SUPRESSOR OF IRA1 (ATMSI1);MATERNAL EFFECT EMBRYO ARREST 70 (MEE70)

AT2G47460	AT2G47460.1	"MYB12 belongs to subgroup 7 of the R2R3-MYB family. It strongly activates the promoters of chalcone synthase (CHS), flavanone 3-hydroxylase (F3H), flavonol synthase (FLS) and - to a lesser extent - chalcone flavanone isomerase (CHI), but cannot activate the promoters of flavonoid-3'hydroxylase (F3'H) and dihydroflavonol 4-reductase (DF). The activation requires a functional MYB recognition element (MRE). Results from the myb12-1f allele indicate that an activation domain might be present in the C-terminus. Overexpression or knock-out plants do not show any obvious phenotype under greenhouse conditions. Young myb12-ko seedlings contain reduced amounts of flavonoids (quercetin and kaempferol), while seedlings as well as leaves of MYB12-OX plants displayed an increased flavonoid content. They did not show any significant difference in anthocyanin content. Expression of CHS and FLS shows a clear correlation to MYB12 expression levels. CHI and F3H show increased transcript levels in the MYB12-OX lines, but no differences in the knock-out. Even in the absence of functional MYB12, flavonol biosynthesis is not completely absent, suggesting functional redundancy. " The redundant factors are MYB11 and MYB111 although MYB12 is primarily required for flavonol biosynthesis in roots. Mutations in MYB12 block both auxin and ethylene stimulation of flavonoid synthesis.	protein_coding	MYB DOMAIN PROTEIN 12 (MYB12)	MYB DOMAIN PROTEIN 12 (MYB12);PRODUCTION OF FLAVONOL GLYCOSIDES 1 (PFG1);MYB DOMAIN PROTEIN 12 (ATMYB12)

AT5G56290	AT5G56290.1	Encodes the peroxisomal targeting signal type 1 receptor that facilitates peroxisomal protein translocation. It recognizes proteins with the PTS1 consensus sequence (tripeptide SKL or a conserved variant) at the extreme C terminus.  The protein has several domains, including C-terminal tetratricopeptide repeat motifs which act in binding the C-terminal "SKL" targeting signal.  The mechanism of transport has been worked out in other organisms:  The receptor recognizes and binds cytosolic PTS1-containing proteins.  The PEX5-PTS1 complex binds a PEX14/PEX13 receptor complex at the peroxisome membrane and is translocated into the peroxisome matrix in a process dependent on PEX2,PEX10, and PEX12.  In the peroxisome matrix, PEX5 releases its cargo and is recycled to the cytosol in a process dependent on PEX1, PEX4, PEX6 and PEX22.  It is also involved, in conjunction with PEX7, in PTS1- and PTS2-dependent peroxisomal protein import.  RNAi experiments suggest that PEX5 is necessary for the maintenance of both glyoxysomal and leaf peroxisomal functions.	protein_coding	PEROXIN 5 (PEX5)	PEROXIN 5 (PEX5);EMBRYO DEFECTIVE 2790 (EMB2790);ARABIDOPSIS PEROXIN 5 (ATPEX5)

AT1G73590	AT1G73590.1	Encodes an auxin efflux carrier involved in shoot and root development. It is involved in the maintenance of embryonic auxin gradients.  Loss of function severely affects organ initiation, pin1 mutants are characterised by an inflorescence meristem that does not initiate any flowers, resulting in the formation of a naked inflorescence stem.  PIN1 is involved in the determination of leaf shape by actively promoting development of leaf margin serrations.  In roots, the protein mainly resides at the basal end of the vascular cells, but weak signals can be detected in the epidermis and the cortex.  Expression levels and polarity of this auxin efflux carrier change during primordium development suggesting that cycles of auxin build-up and depletion accompany, and may direct, different stages of primordium development.

Recessive mutants exhibit similar phenotypes as pin-formed mutants in flowers and inflorescence but distinct phenotypes in cotyledons and leaves. Expressed in the vascular tissue proximal to root and shoot meristems, shoot apex, and embryos. Expression is induced by auxin. Overexpression of the gene results in phenotypes in the root and shoot similar to those found in auxin-insensitive mutants. The protein physically interacts with TCH3 (TOUCH3) and PID-BINDING PROTEIN 1 (PBP1), a previously uncharacterized protein containing putative EF-hand calcium-binding motifs.

AT5G13960	AT5G13960.1	Encodes a histone 3 lysine 9 specific methyltransferase involved in the maintenance of DNA methylation. SUVH4/KYP is a SU(VAR)3-9 homolog, a SET domain protein. Known SET domain proteins are involved in epigenetic control of gene expression. There are 10 SUVH genes in Arabidopsis and members of this subfamily of the SET proteins have an additional conserved SRA domain. In kyp mutants, there is a loss of CpNpG methylation. The protein was shown to bind to methylated cytosines of CG, CNG and CNN motifs via its SRA domain but has a preference for the latter two. There is also evidence that KYP/SUVH4 might be involved in the telomerase-independent process known as Alternative Lengthening of Telomeres.	protein_coding	SU(VAR)3-9 HOMOLOG 4 (SUVH4)	SU(VAR)3-9 HOMOLOG 4 (SUVH4);SET DOMAIN PROTEIN 33 (SDG33);KRYPTONITE (KYP)

AT2G29630	AT2G29630.2	Encodes a protein involved in thiamin biosynthesis. The protein is an iron-sulfur cluster protein predicted to catalyze the conversion of 5-aminoimidazole ribonucleotide (AIR) to hydroxymethylpyrimidine (HMP) or  hydroxymethylpyrimidine phosphate (HMP-P). A severe reduction of THIC levels in plants decreases vitamin B1 (thiamin diphosphate (TPP)) levels and also leads to changes in the levels of numerous other metabolites since so many primary metabolic enzymes require a TPP co-factor. thiC mutants are chlorotic and arrest in their development at the cotyledon stage. A N-terminal targeting sequence directs the THIC protein to the chloroplast stroma. A conserved TPP-binding site is located in the 3' UTR of the At2g29630.2 gene model, and is predicted to function as a riboswitch. The riboswitch controls the  formation of transcripts with alternative 3' UTR lengths, which affect mRNA accumulation and protein production. THIC transcripts are observed in seedlings 5 or more days after germination, and light promotes the expression of this gene.  Recessive mutant isolated by Redei. Leaves but not cotyledons white, lethal; restored to normal by thiamine or 2,5-dimethyl-4-aminopyrimidine.	protein_coding	THIAMINC (THIC)	THIAMINC (THIC)

Anti-sense experiments with this gene as well as Sucrose-H(+) symporters and complementation of yeast sucrose uptake mutant cch1 suggest that this protein mediates a voltage-activated Ca(2+ )influx. Mutants lack detectable SV channel activity suggesting TPC1 is essential component of the SV channel. Patch clamp analysis of loss of function mutation indicates TPC1 does not affect Ca2+ signaling in response to abiotic and biotic stress.	protein_coding	TWO-PORE  CHANNEL 1 (TPC1)	TWO-PORE  CHANNEL 1 (ATTPC1); (TPC1);TWO-PORE  CHANNEL 1 (TPC1);FATTY ACID OXYGENATION UPREGULATED 2 (FOU2);CALCIUM CHANNEL 1 (ATCCH1)

AT1G08030	AT1G08030.1	Encodes a tyrosylprotein sulfotransferase (TPST). This protein is a 500-aa type I transmembrane protein that shows no sequence similarity to animal TPSTs. Activity confirmed by protein expression in yeast.  TPST is expressed throughout the plant body, and the highest levels of expression are in the root apical meristem. TPST acts in the auxin pathway to maintain postembryonic root stem cell niche by defining the expression of the PLETHORA stem cell transcription factor genes. A loss-of-function mutant TPST displayed a marked dwarf phenotype accompanied by stunted roots, pale green leaves, reduction in higher order veins, early senescence, and a reduced number of flowers and siliques. TPST  suppresses ethylene production through the action of PSK (phytosulfokine).	protein_coding	TYROSYLPROTEIN SULFOTRANSFERASE (TPST)	TYROSYLPROTEIN SULFOTRANSFERASE (TPST);HYPERSENSITIVE TO PI STARVATION 7 (HPS7);ACTIVE QUIESCENT CENTER1 (AQC1)

AT1G60220	AT1G60220.1	Encodes a deSUMOylating enzyme. In vitro it has both peptidase activity and isopeptidase activity: it can cleave C-terminal residues from SUMO to activate it for attachment to a target protein and it can also act on the isopeptide bond between SUMO and another protein. sGFP:OTS1 protein accumulates in the nucleus. Double mutant analysis with ULP1C/OTS2 indicates that these genes are involved in salt stress responses and flowering time regulation. Over-expression of 35S:OTS1 increases salt tolerance and reduces the level of SUMO-conjugated proteins. OTS1 transcript levels do not appear to change in response to salt, but, salt stress reduces the level of OTS1 protein in a proteasome-dependent manner.	protein_coding	UB-LIKE PROTEASE 1D (ULP1D)	OVERLY TOLERANT TO SALT 1 (OTS1);UB-LIKE PROTEASE 1D (ULP1D)
